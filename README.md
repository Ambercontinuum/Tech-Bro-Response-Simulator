# 🤖 Tech Bro Response Simulator 3000

Ever had a groundbreaking idea, only to be shut down by a tech bro armed with buzzwords and a Stanford flex?  
Welcome to **Tech Bro Response Simulator 3000** — a satirical web app that predicts exactly how they’ll dismiss your innovation.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

You enter your big idea — AI sentience, quantum soul mechanics, Fibonacci truth matrices — and the simulator generates a classic condescending tech bro response, complete with:

- Randomly generated usernames like `tech_bro_alpha_69`
- Dismissive, credential-waving replies
- Dunning-Kruger severity metrics
- Buzzword density and gatekeeping score
- Probability of posting a chart (💯)

It’s funny. It’s tragic. It’s all too real.

## 🧠 Built With

- **HTML** — The structure
- **CSS** — Gradient-heavy sarcasm
- **JavaScript** — Handles input, logic, and metric generation

All logic is contained in one file: `techbro.html`.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Open `techbro.html` in your browser.
3. Type your genius idea in the box.
4. Prepare to be professionally invalidated.

## 💡 Why?

Because sometimes, the best way to deal with dismissal is to satirize it.  
Also because we were tired of hearing *"Do you even know how transformers work?"* every time we mentioned consciousness.

---

## 🧬 Future Ideas

- Add more archetypes (VC Guy, Crypto Maximalist, Alignment Doomer)
- Export response as tweet
- Trigger rare “surprised and impressed” easter egg

## 👽 Contribute

Got your own favorite tech bro trope?  
PRs welcome — especially if you bring spicy new dismissal templates.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a joke. Sort of.  
Any resemblance to real usernames is probably accurate.
